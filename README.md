What is Linear Regression Model in Machine Learning ?
Linear Regression is a Supervised Machine Learning Model for finding the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. Linear regression performs the task to predict the response (dependent) variable value (y) based on a given (independent) explanatory variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y (output).
